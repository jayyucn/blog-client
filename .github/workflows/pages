# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# 控制工作流什么时候开始执行
on:
  #推送或合并到main分支时触发工作流
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  #允许你在action页签手动执行工作流
  workflow_dispatch:
#工作流由一个或多个任务组成，它们可以串行也可以并行
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          npm run build
